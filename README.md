## Startup success prediction

### **Objective**
The objective is to predict whether a startup which is currently operating turns into a success or a failure. The success of a company is defined as the event that gives the company's founders a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). A company would be considered as failed if it had to be shut down.

### **Overview**
<p>
In this project, we will develop a production model for identifying the determinates of startup company success. We will focus on data preprocessing with sklearn pipelines and prediction interpretation with shap values.</p>

We will then visualize the findings using Matplotlib, NetworkX and Tableau.
